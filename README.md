Project 1 for Applied Cryptography

Project by Zachary Ferrena and Gavin Senger

To run first test:
1) paste plaintext candidates into each append on lines 10-14
2) run Ferrena_Senger_decryption_test1.py
3) paste ciphertext into stdin when prompted

To run second test:
1) put plaintext dictionary seprated by new lines into same folder as decrpytion_test2
2) using console, navigate to folder with Ferrena_Senger_decryption_test2.py, run command python Ferrena_Senger_decryption_test2.py [name of text file]
3) paste ciphertext into stdin

- randomize_plaintext.py is just used to create a set of english words from the dictionary to test dercyption_test2 program
(use steps for second test to run this program, but run command python randomize_plaintext.py [name of text file])

- encrpytion.py takes plaintext candidates from test 1 and encrypts them in order to test functionality of decrpytion_test1
